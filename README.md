# Portfolio
*Welcome*. This is a selection of projects built throughout my time at the University of Utah while working on my [master's degree](https://msd.utah.edu). See my [LinkedIn profile](linkedin.com/in/mattjosse) for more about me.

**Currently, the only project with committed code in this repository is MySSL.** I'm still working on bringing the other projects from private repositories. I hope to have this completed by **September 8** so please come back soon.
