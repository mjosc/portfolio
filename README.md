# Portfolio
A brief selection of projects built while a student of the Master of Software Development program at the University of Utah School of Computing.

## Overview

### EncFS
An encrpyted filesystem implementing the FUSE interface (OSXFuse) in order to avoid direct interaction with the kernel. The encryption algorithms are provided via the cryptography library.

### FitApp
A seemingly random-featured Android app implementing the use of sensors, AWS cloud services, a Room database, and a custom ViewModel combined with Android's official architecture. A three person group effort.

### KNN
An implementation of data structures commonly used to support efficient K-nearest neighbor queries.

### MySSL
A variation of the secure socket layer. Implements a two-way authentication handshake and provides access to read and write methods for applications requiring network encryption. Inheritance of either the MySSLClient or the MySSLServer class provides a simple API.

### PetHotel
A multi-threaded simulation of a pet hotel where each thread represents either a bird, a cat, or a dog. This project received 1st place in a competition for the fastest (and correct) solution.
