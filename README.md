## Overview

### Capstone
An exploration of genealogical data visualizations. This project is mostly private but included here are a few raw back-end playground files with an attempt to explore OrientDB's graph API alongside the SparkJava web framework. Also included are some front-end login/signup pages built with React.

### EncFS
An encrpyted filesystem implementing the FUSE interface (OSXFuse) in order to avoid direct interaction with the kernel. The encryption algorithms are provided via the cryptography library.

### FitApp
A seemingly random-featured Android app implementing the use of sensors, AWS cloud services, a Room database, and a custom ViewModel combined with Android's official architecture. A three person group effort.

### KNN
An implementation of data structures commonly used to support efficient K-nearest neighbor queries.

### MySSL
A variation of the secure socket layer. Implements a two-way authentication handshake and provides access to read and write methods for applications requiring network encryption. Inheritance of either the MySSLClient or the MySSLServer class provides a simple API.

### Pagify
A simulation of virtual memory in the OS. The program represents a music application consisting of a server and multiple clients. Songs are given both a "physical" and "virtual" address. Also includes an analysis of different memory management policies.

### PetHotel
A multi-threaded simulation of a pet hotel where each thread represents either a bird, a cat, or a dog. This project received 1st place in a competition for the fastest (and correct) solution.

### WebChat
A simple messenger front- and back-end implementing web sockets. This was an introductory project to Java, JavaScript and web development in general.
