# KNN (Data Partitioning Models)
An implementation of data structures commonly used to support efficient K-nearest neighbor queries.  
  
This is an ongoing and incomplete project, as might be inferred by the messy main.cpp and some todo comments. **The core functionality as defined in BucketKNN.hpp, KDTree.hpp, and QuadTree.hpp is complete.**

## Disclaimer
This was a project implemented for CS6017 Data Analytics and Visualization. Point.hpp was provided but contains modifications. Stopwatch.hpp and Timer.hpp were provided.
