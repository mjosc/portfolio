# Capstone
An exploration of genealogical data visualizations (playground files). The core of this project is currently private. However, this repository contains sign-up and login-in pages + SPA navigation built with React. It also contains playground files pertaining to a simple (and insecure) REST API back-end built with the SparkJava framework in an attempt to explore OrientDB's graph API.
