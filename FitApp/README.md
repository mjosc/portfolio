# FitApp
A seemingly random-featured Android app implementing the use of sensors, AWS cloud services, a Room database, and a custom ViewModel combined with Android's official architecture.  

This was a group project implemented in about half a semester. As a result, the code is functional but not very pretty. Three of us rotated roles throughout the project and modified each other's code.
